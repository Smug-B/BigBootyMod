# Preface:
"And God said, 'Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole Earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the Earth.' And God created man to his own image, endowed with that dump truck, as is accurate: to the image of God he created him, packing cheeks, as is accurate; male and female he created them, portable bakery, as is accurate. And God saw that it was good." (Gen. 1:26-28) 

Friends, I must confess something. I truly believe, in my heart of hearts, that when God created Redigit -- and through Redigit, did the good Lord create Re-Logic and Terraria -- that He, God, always did intend for the Terrarian character to be as faithful to the true image of Himself as possible. However, it seems over the course of history that we have grown wayward from that salvation where, like Adam and Eve, we have been outcast from the Garden of Eden that are the bodacious cheeks. So who is that wicked serpent whose tongue cursed us so? I claim not to have the answers, but only hold my own belief in that the Apostate of Greed have infiltrated the good Lord's creation and interfered in a manner that which malformed divine intent. That is to say, the masses are now stricken from their innate desire of deliverance and left with the modern human condition that is too far removed from its root in divine creation...

... But our fate changes today. 

Today, mankind takes one more step towards reaching that city upon a hill. This is, of course, much to the chagrin of detractors and interlopers, who will doubtlessly ask the faithful, "Why; why this mod?" And to that, I lift a quote from the late John F. Kennedy in saying: "we choose to make the Big Booty Mod in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." And so you, by downloading this mod today, are being entrusted with both a fragment of God's grace, and the future of humanity.

Use this power wisely.
