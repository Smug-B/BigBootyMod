"And God said, 'Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole Earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the Earth.' And God created man to his own image, endowed with that dump truck, as is accurate: to the image of God he created him, packing cheeks, as is accurate; male and female he created them, portable bakery, as is accurate. And God saw that it was good." (Gen. 1:26-28) 

I believe that when God created Redigit -- and through Redigit he created Terraria -- that the Lord always did intend for the Terrarian character to be as faithful to the true image of Him as possible. And today, mankind takes one more step towards reaching that city upon a hill. Detractors and interlopers will ask the faithful, "Why; why this mod?" And to that I lift a quote from the late John F. Kennedy in saying: "we choose to make the Big Booty Mod in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." And so you, by downloading this mod today, are being entrusted with both a fragment of God's grace, and the future of humanity.

Use this power wisely.
